# Banana Disease Prediction API

This project provides a RESTful API for predicting banana leaf diseases using a deep learning model. Users can upload an image of a banana leaf, and the API will return a prediction indicating whether the leaf is healthy or affected by diseases such as Black Sigatoka or Fusarium wilt.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies banana leaf conditions (e.g., Black Sigatoka, Fusarium wilt, Healthy).
- **REST API**: Simple interface to upload an image and receive a prediction.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles image resizing and normalization automatically.
